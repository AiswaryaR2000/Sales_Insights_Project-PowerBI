Power BI Sales Dashboard â€“ Computer Hardware Business Case Study
Overview: 
This project simulates how data analysis projects are executed in large companies using Power BI.  The case study revolves around a computer hardware business navigating challenges in a dynamically changing market. In response to these issues, the Sales Director has initiated a data analysis project to monitor sales performance and derive actionable insights using interactive dashboards.
Business Scenario:  The company has been facing issues like inconsistent sales across different regions and products, a lack of clear performance metrics, and trouble identifying which products are performing well. To fix this, the dashboard was designed to show key insights like total sales and profit, top-selling products, sales performance by region, monthly and quarterly trends, and customer segments. The idea is to make data easier to understand and help the team make better decisions.
I started by cleaning and preparing the raw sales data, then built relationships between the tables to create a solid data model. I used DAX to create important metrics like total revenue and sales quantity. Finally, I designed a dashboard that tells a clear story and makes it easy for stakeholders to understand the business performance at a glance. This project follows the kind of process you'd go through in a real business intelligence role.
